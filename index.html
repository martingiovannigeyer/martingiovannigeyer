            <h4>Hi, Ciao, Hallo!</h4>
              This website was born out of a desire to express myself.
              Having a variety of different interests, I often think
              that having to condense my life to a one-page CV makes it
              difficult to let me adequately
              communicate the links between the different steps of my life.
              <br><br>
              Take the following as an attempt to bring some of this nuance back, letting you
              zero in on the aspect that matter most to you, and to
              introduce myself, as both the <b>Bocconi alumnus</b> and <b>HEC student</b>
              , but also the the <b>freelance journalist</b>, the
              <b>marathon-runner</b>, and the <b>web developer</b> that coded this page.

            <h4>Beginnings</h4>
            Born and raised in southern Germany,
            I grew up far from the big cities and diverse environments that
            would later dominate my life. My biggest hobbies growing up were
            tennis, track and field, piano, and photography.
            <br> <br />
            In high school, I focused on political studies and physics, while
            taking a number of electives, as well as participating in
            the student counctil and the school newspaper.
            I was a good student and finished fourth among ~100 students
            at high school graduation, with special <b>honors in physics and history</b>.

            <h4>Explorations</h4>
            After highschool, I took a gap year allowing me to <b>work and live in Syndey,
            Berlin, and Shanghai</b> and making me curious on what else the world has to offer. <br><br>
            Upon returning to Europe, I wanted to find a way to make sense of people, societies, nations
            and economies in our globalized world, so in 2017 I started a <b>Bachlor's
            in Economic and Social Science at Bocconi University</b>.
            Subjects ranged from quantitative methods and computer science to
             philosophy, law, cognitive sciences, and sociology, complemented by summer courses in environmental studies,
            geography and urban planning that I took at UCL and LSE in London.

            <h4>Focus</h4>
            Towards the end of my Bachelor years, I came to
            incresingly <b>seek practical applications</b> for the skills and knowledge
            I acquired over the years.
            During my exchange semester in San Diego, I took classes in Marketing and
            Finance and discovered business studies as a way to do exactly that,
            putting knwoledge into practise in various projects while
            letting me making use of my strengths in public speaking and team building. <br><br>
            Upon returning to Milan, I finished my Bachelor's by writing a<b> final paper about financial
            technology and its effects on business and society</b> before moving to France
            to pursue a <b>Master's in Management at HEC Paris</b>.

            <h4>Gap Year</h4>
            After repeatedly being encouraged by friends and family to consider
            studying abroad, I took a gap year, combining my <b>endevour to learn English</b>
            (ironically my worst subject in high school) with my
            childhood dream of going to Sydney. Besides my language studies I started
            working as a retail associate for Sunglass Hut. <br> <br>
            I also used the year off to <b>complete my first two internships</b>,
            and travel through Europe, Australia, and China, mostly by train.
            In one trip, I was following the steps of ancient traders along the silk road,
            visiting places from Xi'an over Jiayuguan until Turpan, and up to the border with Kazakhstan.

            <h4>First Work Experience</h4>
            I collected some first work experience by <b>interning at the Shanghai office of Voith Group</b>,
            a German MNE, which was a big step,
            <b>teaching me the functioning of large MNEs</b> while exposing me to
            an different culture and work mentality. <br><br>
            Afterwards, I moved to Berlin to work for the <b>German
            Liberal Party</b> (FDP) on their election campaign in 2017. I started to become involved
            in politics the year prior during local elections and saw the internship as an
            opportunity to leverage the small party size to get a deep insight into the German
            capital's inner workings. <br><br>

            I continued to practice sports every other day and started practicing <b>CrossFit and Yoga</b> while in Milan,
            and going <b>Sailing and Surfing</b> during my exchange in San Diego.

            <h4>Moving to Paris</h4>
            <p></p>
            It was the third time for me moving to a different country without (fluently)
            speaking the langauge, but many ways the most symbolic.
            For once, it shows <b>the value of opportunities</b> in ones life:
            French was a quasi-mandatory subject in my high school but I never chose to study it.
            When I eventually started my first course in Milan, I couldn't imagine that only shortly after
            I would become a scholarship student at HEC Paris. <br><br>
            Secondly, it shows that the <b>most fulfilling accomplishments are
            achieved through courage and dedication</b>.
            I remember being told that foreign languages are my weak point,
            now I am conversational in three of them. Having accomplished this makes
            me just as proud as my academic or extracurricular achievements.
