            <h4>Beginnings</h4>
            Born and raised in southern Germany,
            I grew up far from the big cities and diverse environments that
            would later dominate my life. My biggest hobbies at the time were
            tennis, track and field, and playing the piano, dj-ing, and photography.
            <br> <br />
            In high school, I focused on political studies and physics and took a
            buch of electives each year.
            I was typically a good student and finished fourth among roughly 100 students
            in my last year in high school, with special honors in Physics and History.
            I was also involved in the student council and habitually
            took part mathematics and debating competitions

            <h4>Explorations</h4>
            My life changed after I took
            a gap year after highschool when my experience of working and living in Syndey,
            Berlin, Shanghai made me curious on what else the world has to offer. <br><br>
            I wanted to find a way to make sense of people, societies, nations
            and economies in our globalized world, so in 2017 I started a Bachlor's
            in Economic and Social Science at Bocconi University.
            Subjects ranged from quantitative methods over philosophy, law, and sociology,
            to cognitive sciences, complemented by summer courses in environmental studies,
            geography and urban planning that I took at UCL and LSE in London.

            <h4>Focusing</h4>
            Towards the end of my Bachelor years, I came to
            incresingly seek applications for the skills and knowledge
            I acquired, which until then I only found through extracuricular applications.
            During my exchange semester in San Diego, I took classes in Marketing and
            Finance and discovered business studies as a way to do exactly that,
            letting me making use of strengths in
            public speaking and team building. <br><br>
            Upon returning to Milan, I finished my Bachelor's by writing a final paper about financial
            technology and its effects on business and society before moving to France
            to pursue a Master's in Management at HEC Paris.

            <h4>Gap Year</h4>
            After being repeatedly encouraged by friends and family to consider
            studying abroad, I took a gap year, combining my endevour to learn English
            (my worst subject in high school) with my
            childhood dream of going to Sydney. Besides my language studies I started
            working as a retail associate for Sunglass Hut, and travelled around the country
            whenever I got some time off. <br> <br>
            I also used the year off to complete my first two internships, and travel through Europe and China by train.
            In one trip, I was following the steps of ancient traders along the silk road,
            visiting places from Xi'an over Jiayuguan until Turpan and into Kazakhstan.

            <h4>First Work Experience</h4>
            I collected some first work experience by interning at the Shanghai office of Voith Group,
            a German MNE, which was a big step,
            teaching me the inner working of a large multinational while exposing me to
            an different culture and work mentality. <br><br>
            After completing my first internship, I moved to Berlin to work for the German
            Liberal Party (FDP) on their election campaign in 2017. I started becoming involved
            in politics the year prior during local elections and saw the internship as an
            opportunity to leverage the small party size to get deep insights into the German
            capital's inner workings. <br><br>

            At Bocconi, I started freelancing for Handelsblatt, Germany's leading

            student associations nextPa, where I served as Head of Smart Cities, and Green Light for Business,
            where I was elected Communications Manager, leading a team of up to 20 students for almost two years. <br><br>
            I continues to do much sports, starting to do up CrossFit, Yoga, Surfing,
            and Sailing, the latter two I picked up during my exchange in San Diego.<br><br>
            Finally, I spent a considerable time on online courses learning Data Analysis
            and Web Design.

            <h4>Moving to Paris</h4>
            <p></p>
            It was the third time for me moving to a different country without (fluently)
            speaking the langauge, but many ways the most symbolic.
            For once, it shows the value of opportunities in ones life:
            French was a valued subject in my high school but I never chose it.
            When I eventually started my first course, I couldn't imagine that only shortly after
            I would move to Paris. <br><br>
            Secondly, it shows that the most fulfilling accomplishments can only be
            reached through courage and dedication.
            I remember being told that foreign languages are my weak point,
            now I am conversational in three of them, and that's what I am most proud of today.
