                <h4>Tech and Digital </h4>
                After being introduced to Java during highschool,
                R and python during college, and html thorugh my activity at
                Green Light for Business, I started to get increasingly interested in coding
                and development. Through online courses, I furthered my skills,
                allowing me to build create website and automate many of my tasks at univerity.
                <br> <br>
                Over the years, I built tools to automatically download lecture notes from BlackBoard,
                (via python), run an unlimited number of liner regressions simulatenously in excel (via VBA),
                or create a conjoint analysis survey from an excel sheet (via Apps Script)

               <h4>Language and Culture</h4>
              When I left my hometown for Australia in 2016 to learn English,
              I wouldn't have guessed that five years later, I would have <b>worked and studied
              in seven countries</b>  across four continentsand reach <b>conversational fluency in
              four languages</b>. <br><br>
              My experience in Australia
              made me confident to be able to stand on my own feet and my subsequent time in
              China was wonderful in introducing me to an entirely different culture and mindset
              from what I was used. This together with my various travels, many of which included
              less known destinations such as Montengro or Kazakhstan led me to build a truly global
              mindset as well as a unique cultural competence and extraordinarily diverse group of friends.

                <h4>Sustainability</h4>
                I first got truly interested in sustainability when I
                <a href="https://www.gl4b.eu/2017/11/expo-2017-milestone-or-death-star.html">
                visited the Expo 2017</a> in Astana, Kazakhstan. Seeing countries from
                all over the world presenting their ideas for a sustainable energy got me
                excited about the future we are about to live in if we make the right decisions
                in the upcoming decade. <br><br>
                Following the fair, sustainability was a constant theme in my CV, whether through
                my extracurricular activities, my summer courses at UCL and LSE, or my elective
                choices at HEC.

                <h4>Fitness and Health</h4>
                In Milan, a large banner spelling <b>"Mens sana in corpore sano"</b> was welcoming
                me each morning when going to the gym before class.
                It remained one of my guiding principles to this date. <br><br>
                Having tried a variety of sports over the years, I particularly enjoy those
                letting me practise focus, like tennis, surfing, and strength training, and
                endurance, like cycling and running.
                Frequently running from HEC to Paris and back, I hope to comeplete
                my first official marathon by the end of the year.

                <h4>Art and Society</h4> Art has always
                helped humanity to critically reflect upon changes in their environment and
                broader society. As such, I think that in a time of rapid technological change
                art has a more important role than ever. The image you see at the front depicts a work by
                Tatsuo Mijayima, which I had the chance to see in the Syndey MCA in 2016. It uses LED
                lights, an omnipresent symbol of the 21 century, <a href="https://tatsuomiyajima.com/work-projects/mega-death-3/">
                to reflect upon the very essence of human existence</a>. <br><br>
                In a similar fashion, I developed a fascination for mid-century literature, whether
                Albert Camus, George Orwell, Ayn Rand, or Max Frisch, each of which developed a unique
                style of describing and critizicing the changes in society occuring at the time.
