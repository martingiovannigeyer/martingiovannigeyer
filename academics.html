              completing a Bachelor's in Economic and Social Sciences. It was exciting to be
              in the pioneering class of this program, which, although it traces back to a long history
              was first taught in English and its new revised form. As such, our class benefitted from
              a revised curriculum including many leading edge issues in Economics, while being based
              on rigurous quantitative methods.

              the USA's sunny westcoast. Studying at SDSU was thus as much a personal as much
              a personal as an academic endevour. On the academic side, I enjoyed the
              American style assessment methods, including oral participation and group work.
              On the personal side, I made use of the academic flexibility to take courses in
              drawing and design as well as surfing and sailing.

              <p class="description3" >Coming to London for two summer courses at the London School of Economics was
              exciting to me for two reasons. First, as it gave me the chance to study some
              topics I was interested in that weren't part of my Bachelors and secondly it allowed
              me to see how explore a different educational system. On a side note,
              I also met some of the most incredible people of my life there,
              many of which I am friends to this day.

              Why? There's just a certain fascination in me for creating things that last and
              affect our everyday life. While I chose not to pursue Architecture as a career,
              I remained interested in the field and doing a course in Urban Planning at UCL
              was a way for me to pursue this interest alongside my main studies, living out
              the creative side of me.
