                <h4>Tech and Digital </h4>
                After getting my first introduction into Python as part of a computer science course
              during my Bachelors, I was quickly fascianted by the various applications it can have
              ranging from web development, over financial analysis to machine learning.
              I decided to venture into the latter two fields by completing a number of online courses.
              Having done so allowed me to automate several tasks, such as the data collection and analysis
              for a recent marketing project. <br>
              Throughout my time at Green Light for Business, I also started to become interested in
              web development and since use this website as a sandbox for my learning

               <h4>Language and Culture</h4>
              When I left my hometown for Australia in 2016 to learn English,
              I wouldn't have guessed that five years later, I would have worked and studied
              in seven countries across four continents and reach conversational fluency in
              four languages. In a way, one thing led to another - my experience in Australia
              made me confident to be able to stand on my own feet and my subsequent time in
              China was wonderful in introducing me to a completely different culture and mindset
              from what I was used. This together with my various travels, many of which included
              less known destinations such as Montengro or Kazakhstan led me to build a truly global
              mindset as well as a unique cultural competence and extraordinarily diverse group of friends.
