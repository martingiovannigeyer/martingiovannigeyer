        <h4>HEC Paris</h4>
        <p class="description2">As of early
          2021, I'm a student at HEC Paris, doing my Master's in Management and currently
          close to completing my first year in France. I see my masters as a way to deepen
          my knowledge in fields I am interested in  (Tech, Sustainability,
          Entrepreneurship) and to eventually focus on one  of those topics during my M2
          year. That being said, I see my studies as a means to what I want to achieve
          rather than rather than maintaining , I was always focussed on learning as much
          as possible whether it is relevant for the exam or just for myself.
