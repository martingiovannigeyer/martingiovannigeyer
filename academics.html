            As of early
            2021, I'm a student at HEC Paris, doing my Master's in Management and currently
            close to completing my first year in France. I see my masters as a way to deepen
            my knowledge in fields I am interested in  (Tech, Sustainability,
            Entrepreneurship) and to eventually focus on one  of those topics during my M2
            year. That being said, I see my studies as a means to what I want to achieve
            rather than rather than maintaining , I was always focussed on learning as much
            as possible whether it is relevant for the exam or just for myself.

<h4>Bocconi Univerity</h4>
            From September 2017 until July 2020, I studied at Bocconi Univerity in Milan,
            completing a Bachelor's in Economic and Social Sciences. It was exciting to be
            in the pioneering class of this program, which, although it traces back to a long history
            was first taught in English and its new revised form. As such, our class benefitted from
            a revised curriculum including many leading edge issues in Economics, while being based
            on rigurous quantitative methods.

            <h4>San Diego State University</h4>
            During the second half of 2019, I took the chance to leave Europe for
            the USA's sunny westcoast. Studying at SDSU was thus as much a personal as much
            a personal as an academic endevour. On the academic side, I enjoyed the
            American style assessment methods, including oral participation and group work.
            On the personal side, I made use of the academic flexibility to take courses in
            drawing and design as well as surfing and sailing.

            <h4>London School of Economics</h4>
            Coming to London for two summer courses at the London School of Economics was
            exciting to me for two reasons. First, as it gave me the chance to study some
            topics I was interested in that weren't part of my Bachelors and secondly it allowed
            me to see how explore a different educational system. On a side note,
            I also met some of the most incredible people of my life there,
            many of which I am friends to this day.

            Had I not studied Economics, I think I would have chosen Architecture.
            Why? There's just a certain fascination in me for creating things that last and
            affect our everyday life. While I chose not to pursue Architecture as a career,
            I remained interested in the field and doing a course in Urban Planning at UCL
            was a way for me to pursue this interest alongside my main studies, living out
            the creative side of me.
