            <h4>HEC Paris</h4>
            As of early
            2021, I'm a student at HEC Paris, currently <b>in my first year of a
            Master's in Management</b>. I see the program as a way to deepen
            my knowledge in fields I am interested in (Tech, Sustainability,
            Entrepreneurship) and to eventually focus on one of those topics during my M2
            year. <br><br>
            As such, the  aspects I enjoy most about HEC Paris include its <b>focus on collaboration</b> and
            team-work as well as its entrepreneurial spirit and recent <b>pivot to sustainability-related
            courses</b>, allowing me to take electives such as
            Sustainability Strategy, Hydrogen Markets, and EU Energy Policy.
            I further had the chance to improve my French via free langauge courses and am currently
            attending the French-speaking elective <b>"Créer et développer une start-up technologique"</b>

            <h4>Bocconi Univerity</h4>
            From September 2017 until July 2020, I studied at Bocconi Univerity in Milan,
            completing a Bachelor's in Economic and Social Sciences. It was exciting to be
            in the pioneering class of this program, which, although its Italian predecessor traces
            back many decades, was first taught in English and its new revised form.
            As such, our class benefitted from
            a <b>cutting-edge curriculum in Economics, Behavioral Studies, Sociology, Philosophy,
            Law and more</b>, while being based on rigurous quantitative methods.<br><br>
            What I most enjoyed in this holistic teaching was that it allows me to
            assess the <b>impact of innovative businesses on broader society</b>, which became valuable when
            I wrote my final paper about financial technology and its effects on industries
            and customers alike.

            During the second half of 2019, I took the chance to leave Milan for
            the USA's sunny westcoast. Studying at SDSU was thus as much a personal
            as an academic endevour. On the academic side, I enjoyed the
            American style assessment methods, including oral participation and group work.
            as well as the more busines-related courses I took there. <br><br>
            On the personal side, I made use of the academic flexibility to take courses in
            drawing and design as well as surfing and sailing and visited friends all over the
            West Coast which I had gotten to know over the previous years.

            <h4>London School of Economics</h4>
            Coming to London for two summer courses at the London School of Economics was
            exciting to me for two reasons. First, it gave me the chance to study some
            topics I that perfectly complemented my Bachelor's but were not offered at Bocconi
            until the third year. I took in Urban Geography, learning about social struggles
            in modern cities, and Environmental Economics, which would prove very benefitial
            in my later studies and extracurricular acitivites at Bocconi and HEC. <br><br>
            Going to London also let me experience another educational system, one that I had
            already considered for my Bachelor's was considering once again for my Master's.
            Had it not been for my pivot to business studies and the UK's departure from the
            EU, it is likely I would have pursued my Master's at LSE as well.

            <h4>Univerity College London</h4>
            Besides the broader field of social sciences, both architecture
            and engineering were always a deep fascination of mine.
            Just like successful businesses in technology and consumer goods,
            architects and engineers can create lasting things that
            affect our everyday life.  <br><br>
            While I chose not to pursue either as a career,
            I remained interested in the fields and doing the course "<b>Future Cities and
            Energy Systems</b>" at UCL was a way for me to pursue this interest
            alongside my main studies. The course taught us about the challanges in
            decarbonizing cities, looking at both their building stock and energy
            infrastructure. In our final project, we reenvisioned the famous
            Barbican complex in The City of London,
            built with modern sustainability standards in mind.

            <h4>Datacamp, Udemy, EdX</h4>
            In my second semester at Bocconi, I took my first computer science course,
            covering the fundamentals of Python and data analysis within the program.
            Witnessing my motivation, my professor suggested me to continue my learning
            by taking online courses such as the ones on Datacamp. <br><br>
            I quickly signed up for courses in Machine Learning, Financial Analysis,
            Data Analytics, and Web Development, six of which I have completed
            within the past two years and two of which I am currently working on.
