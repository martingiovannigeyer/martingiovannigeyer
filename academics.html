          2021, I'm a student at HEC Paris, doing my Master's in Management and currently

          Entrepreneurship) and to eventually focus on one  of those topics during my M2
          year. That being said, I see my studies as a means to what I want to achieve
          rather than rather than maintaining , I was always focussed on learning as much
