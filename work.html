            <h4>Voith Industrial Services</h4>
              Interning at Voith Industrial Services in Shanghai was an exceptional opportunity for me
              to both get first work experiene in a multinational enterprise, <b>gaining an insight into
              various sectors such as Business Development, Operations, and HR</b>, as well as building my
              cultural competence working with a diverse team of German and Chinese coworkers. Both of
              these competences would benefit me tremendously later on in my life. <br><br>
              During my time in Shanghai, I worked on a variety of projects, including <b>researching and
              updating our database</b> of actual and potential customers, handling a variety of HR requests,
              and <b>assisting communications in a major
              project</b> involving the relocation of a production facility.

            <h4>Junge Liberale</h4>
            I was working for the German Youth Liberals, the youth organization
            of the German Liberal Party during the 2017 federal elections in Germany.<b>
            In a time of rising xenophobia and euro-scepticism, I found it crucial to
            support centrist, liberal, and pro-european ideas. </b><br><br>
            During my time in Berlin, I <b>worked on everything from the party's
            social media and online presence to the organization of campaign rallies</b>
            and had the great honor to meet some of the most impressive and determined
            people of my life, many of which now hold major political offices.

            <h4>Handelsblatt</h4>
              In early 2018, I started <b>writing for the leading German financial newspaper</b>,
              Handelsblatt, reporting on the ongoing Italian election while making use of the
              knowledge acquired by working in politics the year prior. My articles and comments
              revolved around the <b>need for political participation among members of my generation</b> by
              presenting young politician from different political sides and their reasons
              for being active in politics. <br><br>
              In another article explaining the Italian election system, I highlighted the
              <b>value of, as an EU citizen, being informed about politics and society in other
              member states</b> as it like has an effect on ones own home country.

              When joining the student association in 2017, I initially <b>wrote for the blog</b>, before starting to manage some of our
              media accounts and working as a graphic designer. After my first year at the associaton, I got
              <b>promoted to become Communications Manager</b>, leading a team of up to 20 students and managing all
              communication channels. <br><br>
              Throughout this time, we <b>doubled the number of blog posts per month</b> and significantly
              <b>increased our following on all social media channels</b>. More than anything, however, I am proud to have
              built a team that continues to perform exceptionally well after I left the association when finishing my studies at Bocconi.

               a substantial source of income, covering most of my living expenses. <br><br>
              My investment process starts with sectors I come across during various curricular and extracurricular activities.
              Once having found a company of intrerest, I conduct<b> extensive research on both their financials and business model.</b>
              I further try to attended the shareholder meetings to stay updated on
              recent developments and, whenever possible, <b>talk directly to executives</b>
              to ask questions I might have about the comapny's strategy, as was recently the case for Moncler.
